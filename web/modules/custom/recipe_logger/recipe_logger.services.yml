# The most important file for creating services in Drupal is .services.yml file.
# In a module the service yml file can be created & named as <module_machine_name>.servcies.yml
# Since this file is a yml file. It contains the data in key, value format (standard yaml format).
# Services is a symfony concept introduced in Drupal from Drupal version 8.

# mymodule.custom_services:
#   class: Drupal\mymodule\CustomService
#   arguments: ['@current_user']

# module_name.service_name:
#   class_location: namespace_of_the_class
#   additional_settings (ex. arguments, etc..)

# Example of arguments - if the service is dependent upon another service than the service can be passed as argument with " @ " prefix. ex. @database
## if the service is dependent upon a parameter ex. app_root, then parameter should be prefixed & suffixed by %. ex. %app_root%.
