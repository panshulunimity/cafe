# Optimizing Drupal to load faster (Server, MySQL, caching, theming, HTML)

## Caching

- Internal Page Cache 
- Internal Dynamic Page Caching
- Memcache / Redis Implementation
- Effective Drupal Custom caching implementation using Cache API
- We should know when to clear cache and which cache bin should be cleared?

## APM (Application Performance Monitoring)

- There should be some way to measure the performance of a drupal application.
- One of the most comprehensive and easy to use tools is Googleâ€™s PageSpeed Insights tool. This tool can very quickly and clearly highlight potential performance improvements that apply for your site.
- Some tools like - New Relic, BlackFire can be really helpful in analysing and working on the fixes required for performance improvement.

### Backend Analysis

- Code flow
- Listing pages
- Node loads
- Custom queries to fetch data.
- Uncached custom implementations

### Frontend Analysis

- CSS/JS aggregation
- No processing / compression done on images
- Attaching heavy assets on to the page

## Drupal Coding Standards 

- Drupal PHP Coding Standards
- Drupal CSS/JS Coding Standards

## CDN

- What is it? Why should you use it?
- What if we don't use any CDN?

## Code Security Should be taken care of!

## Other Important Performance Improvement Metrics

- API associated data - When to fetch fresh data, how to store the data & how to maintain the data?
- Contributed Modules used on the website.
- Drupal Version & PHP version to be updated, similarly all third party libraries used on the website.
