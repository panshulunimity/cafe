# What is a component based approach?

Component based approach for building a website is to make sure that every part of the website acts as a component that may be re-usable, pluggable, replaceable and has the ability to extend itself.

Ex. Blocks in Drupal - They are the best basic example of component based approach.

# Advantages of using this approach?

## Editor Experience - 
- Notice all the ways we have discused to create components on the site. They provide a way to strengthen the editing experience of a website.
- Editors feel that they have more control over the apperance of the page, be it a landing page or a listing page.

## Increases Re-usablility
- All the components that you have created will be available to be used across multiple pages. - This is what we mean when we say it is a component! A component is a collection of information or a piece of information that can be displayed across multiple pages with same or different content depending upon the requirement of designing the page.

## Layout builder is the new drupal hero!
